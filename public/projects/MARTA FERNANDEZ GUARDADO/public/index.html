					<p>The architectural construction is obviously a necessary requirement to create space, but it is not
						sufficient. Unlike territory, architecture needs relate to people in order to be complete; it needs
						to be inhabited. This binding process depends on the identification offered by the architecture
					and the actions and transformations that the inhabitants perform in it.</p>

					<p>The phenomenon intensifies in housing architecture, which crisis in Europe still continues.
						Costs rise faster than incomes, particularly in major cities. Construction recovers slower than
						prices and shortage drives them up even more. Due to economical speculation, housing has
						become an investment objective economically “in use&quot; even when houses are unoccupied. The
						market remains conservative and the housing model hardly evolves, identifying fewer and fewer
						people. Labour mobility, leisure long-term displacements and other migration flows are
						transferring our homes to not permanent and not owned, new platforms. Meaningful actions in
						the domestic space are discarded, especially among young renters. Objects (own, borrowed or
						shared) and ceremonies (daily, as a host or as a guest) become indispensable mechanisms to
					relate ourselves to the place we live in, and consequently part of the architecture.</p>

					<p>Home is no more one and forever, but remains a place for protection, and even for presentation,
						reproduction and production. Its floor plan still represents a fragmented domesticity with specific
						rooms for every action, but not every action is always the same nor happens at the same time.
						Its furniture and equipment are used to program spaces, but not to program lives, which are
						constantly changing. The bed, for instance, traditionally one of the most intimate domestic
						inventions, is overtaking the sofa as the most used item of furniture and even becoming a
					regular working place.</p>

					<p>The big and small architectural traditions that shape our lives are just assumptions that can be
						observed, questioned and redesigned. Meanwhile, in this context of crisis, mostly understood in
						economically terms, the capacity of radical exploration of architecture seems limited. Can the
						architect propose alternative explorations to the building? Can the architectural thinking apply to
						other scales and times? If space is created from the body, are there other active architectural
						bodies that may be used to relate people to foreign architectures, and even to other people and
						themselves? Can architectural ideas be tested through those bodies and be potentially applied
						to the architecture afterwards? Could they integrate emerging alternative domestic practises out
						of the dichotomy public/private, which architecture has not yet reached?
						The study proposes an object-based design investigation of the domestic environment as an
						architecture where things and bodies cohabit, in order to explore the architectural statement for
					contemporary ways of living.</p>
