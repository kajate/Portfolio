      <p>One hundred and ninety-one floors up, you look over the edge of the roof and the street
        below is mottled with a shag carpet of people, standing, looking up. The breaking glass is a
        window right below us. A window blows out the side of the building, and then comes a file
        cabinet big as a black refrigerator, right below us a six-drawer filing cabinet drops right out of
        the cliff face of the building, and drops turning slowly, and drops getting smaller, and drops
        disappearing into the packed crowd.<br><br>
        Somewhere in the one hundred and ninety-one floors under us, the space monkeys in the
        Mischief Committee of  are running wild, destroying every scrap of history.
        That old saying, how you always kill the one you love, well, look, it works both ways.
        With a gun stuck in your mouth and the barrel of the gun between your teeth, you can only
        talk in vowels.<br><br>
        We're down to our last ten minutes.</p><br><br>
        <p>Another window blows out of the building, and glass sprays out, sparkling flock-of-pigeons
            style, and then a dark wooden desk pushed by the Mischief Committee emerges inch by inch
            from the side of the building until the desk tilts and slides and turns end-over-end into a
            magic flying thing lost in the crowd.<br><br>
            The Building won't be here in nine minutes. You take enough blasting gelatin
            and wrap the foundation columns of anything, you can topple any building in the world. You
            have to tamp it good and tight with sandbags so the blast goes against the column and not
            out into the parking garage around the column.<br><br>
            This how-to stuff isn't in any history book.<br><br>
            The three ways to make napalm: One, you can mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange
            juice concentrate. Two, you can mix equal parts of gasoline and diet cola. Three, you can
            dissolve crumbled cat litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
            Ask me how to make nerve gas. Oh, all those crazy car bombs.<br><br>
            Nine minutes.</p><br><br>
            <p>The Building will go over, all one hundred and ninety-one floors, slow as a tree
                falling in the forest. Timber. You can topple anything. It's weird to think the place where we're
                standing will only be a point in the sky.<br><br>
                You and I meat the edge of the roof, the gun in my mouth, I'm wondering how clean this gun
                is.<br><br>
                We just totally forget about your whole murder-suicide thing while we watch another file
                cabinet slip out the side of the building and the drawers roll open midair, reams of white paper
                caught in the updraft and carried off on the wind.<br><br>

                Eight minutes.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Then the smoke, smoke starts out of the broken windows. The demolition team will hit the
                primary charge in maybe eight minutes. The primary charge will blow the base charge, the
                foundation columns will crumble, and the photo series of the Building will go
                into all the history books.<br><br>
                The five-picture time-lapse series. Here, the building's standing. Second picture, the building
                will be at an eighty-degree angle. Then a seventy-degree angle. The building's at a forty-fivedegree
                angle in the fourth picture when the skeleton starts to give and the tower gets a slight
                arch to it. The last shot, the tower, all one hundred and ninety-one floors, will slam down on
                the national museum which is our real target.<br><br>
                "This is our world, now, our world," you say, "and those ancient people are dead."
                If I knew how this would all turn out, I'd be more than happy to be dead and in Heaven right
                now.<br><br>

                Seven minutes.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Up on top of the Building with the gun in my mouth. While desks and filing
                    cabinets and computers meteor down on the crowd around the building and smoke funnels
                    up from the broken windows and three blocks down the street the demolition team watches
                    the clock, I know all of this: the gun, the anarchy, the explosion is really about Marla Singer.
                    <br><br>
                    Six minutes.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>We have sort of a triangle thing going here. I want you. You wants her. She wants me.
                        I don't want her, and you don't want me around, not anymore. This isn't about love as in
                        caring. This is about property as in ownership.
                        Without her, you would have nothing.
                        <br><br>
                        Five minutes.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>Maybe we would become a legend, maybe not. No, I say, but wait.
                            Where would Jesus be if no one had written the gospels?
                            <br><br>
                            Four minutes.
                            <br><br>
                            I tongue the gun barrel into my cheek and say, you want to be a legend, man, I'll make
                            you a legend. I've been here from the beginning.
                            I remember everything.
                            <br><br>
                            Three minutes.
                            <br><br>
                            I can sleep in heaven.</p>
                            <br><br>
                            <p>People write to me in heaven and tell me I'm remembered. That I'm their hero. I'll get better.
                                The angels here are the Old Testament kind, legions and lieutenants, a heavenly host who
                                works in shifts, days, swing. Graveyard. They bring you your meals on a tray with a paper cup
                                of meds. The Valley of the Dolls playset.
                                <br><br>
                                I've met God across his long walnut desk with his diplomas hanging on the wall behind him,
                                and God asks me, "Why?"
                                <br><br>
                                Why did I cause so much pain?
                                <br><br>
                                Didn't I realize that each of us is a sacred, unique snowflake of special unique specialness?
                                Can't I see how we're all manifestations of love?
                                <br><br>
                                I look at God behind his desk, taking notes on a pad, but God's got this all wrong.
                                <br><br>
                                We are not special.
                                <br><br>
                                We are not crap or trash, either.
                                <br><br>
                                We just are.
                                <br><br>
                                We just are, and what happens just happens.
                                <br><br>
                                And God says, "No, that's not right."
                                <br><br>
                                Yeah. Well. Whatever. You can't teach God anything.
                                <br><br>
                                God asks me what I remember.
                                <br><br>
                                I remember everything.</p>
                                <br><br>
                                <p>The bullet out of the gun, it tore out my other cheek to give me a jagged smile from ear to
                                    ear. Yeah, just like an angry Halloween pumpkin. Japanese demon. Dragon of Avarice.
                                    She's still on Earth, and she writes to me. Someday, she says, they'll bring me back.
                                    And if there were a telephone in Heaven, I would call her from Heaven and the moment she
                                    says, "Hello," I wouldn't hang up. I'd say, "Hi. What's happening? Tell me every little thing."
                                    <br><br>
                                    But I don't want to go back. Not yet.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Just because.</p>
